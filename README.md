# T-shirt Sale

The local t-shirt shop sells shirts that retail for $12. Quantity discounts are given as follows:  

Number of Shirts |	Discount  
-----------------|---------
5–10 		|	10% 
11–20 		|	15%  
21–30 		|	20%  
31 or more 	|	25%  

Write a program that prompts the user for the number of shirts required and then computes the total price. Make sure the program accepts only nonnegative input (do not need to use a loop). Multi-way if-else statements can be used to implement the program logic.

Use the following sample runs to guide you:

_Sample Run 1:_  
How many shirts would you like ?  
**4**  
The cost per shirt is $12 and the total cost is $48  

_Sample Run 2:_  
How many shirts would you like ?  
**0**  
The cost per shirt is $12 and the total cost is $0  

_Sample Run 3:_  
How many shirts would you like ?  
**8**  
The cost per shirt is $10.80 and the total cost is $86.40  

_Sample Run 4:_  
How many shirts would you like ?  
**-2**  
Invalid Input: Please enter a nonnegative integer
